And remember, if you have any questions along the way, don&#39;t hesitate to reach out to your tutor! | . Analyzing borrowers&#8217; risk of defaulting . Your project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. . Your report will be considered when building a credit scoring of a potential customer. A credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan. . Step 1. Open the data file and have a look at the general information. . import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(&#39;/datasets/credit_scoring_eng.csv&#39;) pd.set_option(&#39;display.max_row&#39;,100) df.info() # the days_employed are negative # there exists NaN values . &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; RangeIndex: 21525 entries, 0 to 21524 Data columns (total 12 columns): children 21525 non-null int64 days_employed 19351 non-null float64 dob_years 21525 non-null int64 education 21525 non-null object education_id 21525 non-null int64 family_status 21525 non-null object family_status_id 21525 non-null int64 gender 21525 non-null object income_type 21525 non-null object debt 21525 non-null int64 total_income 19351 non-null float64 purpose 21525 non-null object dtypes: float64(2), int64(5), object(5) memory usage: 2.0+ MB . Needs fixing: Please, don&#39;t forget about &#39;.info()&#39; method next time. Success (review 2): Well done! Conclusion . On first glace I noticed: . -days employed are negative . -there exists NaN values in the days_employed and total_income columns. It would be safe to say that the two columns are correlated because one cannot calculate total_income without days employed. The reason for the missing values could be human error. Maybe the employees are new hires so data does not exist as of yet. . -education needs to be lowercase -purpose might need to be grouped together? . Step 2. Data preprocessing . Processing missing values . df.isnull().sum() df.dropna(inplace=True) . Conclusion . I chose to drop the missing values because I do not have the data to fill them in. Filling in n/a with the mean value would be wrong. I could have also replaced the n/a values with 0. 2174 lines were dropped in days_employed and total_income. . Improve: This solution is acceptable but please print how many lines were dropped. Maybe you&#39;ve deleted all dataset? Data type replacement . df[&#39;days_employed&#39;] = df[&#39;days_employed&#39;].astype(int) df[&#39;days_employed&#39;] = df[&#39;days_employed&#39;].abs() df[&#39;total_income&#39;] = df[&#39;total_income&#39;].astype(int) df[&#39;education&#39;] = df[&#39;education&#39;].str.lower() df[&#39;purpose&#39;] = df[&#39;purpose&#39;].str.lower() df[&#39;family_status&#39;] = df[&#39;family_status&#39;].str.lower() df[&#39;income_type&#39;] = df[&#39;income_type&#39;].str.lower() df . children days_employed dob_years education education_id family_status family_status_id gender income_type debt total_income purpose . 0 | 1 | 8437 | 42 | bachelor&#39;s degree | 0 | married | 0 | F | employee | 0 | 40620 | purchase of the house | . 1 | 1 | 4024 | 36 | secondary education | 1 | married | 0 | F | employee | 0 | 17932 | car purchase | . 2 | 0 | 5623 | 33 | secondary education | 1 | married | 0 | M | employee | 0 | 23341 | purchase of the house | . 3 | 3 | 4124 | 32 | secondary education | 1 | married | 0 | M | employee | 0 | 42820 | supplementary education | . 4 | 0 | 340266 | 53 | secondary education | 1 | civil partnership | 1 | F | retiree | 0 | 25378 | to have a wedding | . ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | . 21520 | 1 | 4529 | 43 | secondary education | 1 | civil partnership | 1 | F | business | 0 | 35966 | housing transactions | . 21521 | 0 | 343937 | 67 | secondary education | 1 | married | 0 | F | retiree | 0 | 24959 | purchase of a car | . 21522 | 1 | 2113 | 38 | secondary education | 1 | civil partnership | 1 | M | employee | 1 | 14347 | property | . 21523 | 3 | 3112 | 38 | secondary education | 1 | married | 0 | M | employee | 1 | 39054 | buying my own car | . 21524 | 2 | 1984 | 40 | secondary education | 1 | married | 0 | F | employee | 0 | 13127 | to buy a car | . 19351 rows × 12 columns . Conclusion . -days employed is now int instead of float, the absolute value was taken to get positive numbers -total income was changed to int instead of float because the cents don&#39;t really matter -education was changed to lower to make categorization easier . Success: Well done! Processing duplicates . df2 = df.duplicated().sum() df.drop_duplicates().reset_index(drop=True) print(df.dtypes) . children int64 days_employed int64 dob_years int64 education object education_id int64 family_status object family_status_id int64 gender object income_type object debt int64 total_income int64 purpose object dtype: object . Conclusion . Duplicates if they existed are now dropped from the DataFrame using the drop_duplicates method. The drop_duplicates method was used with the argument &quot;inplace=True&quot; because we want the changes to be made on the original DataFrame. df2 = df.duplicated().sum() shows that there are 0 lines in the DataFrame that are duplicated. No lines were deleted. . Improve: Please, print how many lines were deleted. Categorizing Data . def income_level(row): income = int(row[&#39;total_income&#39;]) if income &lt; 20000: return &#39;Poverty&#39; elif 20000 &lt;= income &lt;= 44000: return &#39;Low Income&#39; elif 45000 &lt;= income &lt;= 139000: return &#39;Middle Class&#39; elif 140000 &lt;= income &lt;= 149000: return &#39;Upper Middle Class&#39; elif 150000 &lt;= income &lt;= 199999: return &#39;High Income&#39; else: if income &gt;= 200000: return &#39;Highest Tax Bracket&#39; row_values = [&#39;1500000&#39;] row = pd.Series(data=row_values, index=[&#39;total_income&#39;]) income_level(row) df[&#39;income_level&#39;] = df.apply(income_level, axis=1) def have_kids(new_row): kids = int(new_row[&#39;children&#39;]) if kids &gt; 0: return &#39;1&#39; else: return &#39;0&#39; new_row_values = [&#39;0&#39;] new_row = pd.Series(data=new_row_values, index=[&#39;children&#39;]) have_kids(new_row) df[&#39;have_kids&#39;] = df.apply(have_kids, axis=1) # Creating Pivot Tables df[&#39;kids_ratio&#39;] = df[&#39;children&#39;]/df[&#39;children&#39;].sum() #df.pivot_table(index=[&#39;have_kids&#39;, &#39;kids_ratio&#39;], values=&#39;debt&#39;) df[&#39;kids_ratio&#39;].count() #df.pivot_table(index=&#39;family_status&#39;, values=&#39;debt&#39;) #df.pivot_table(index=&#39;income_level&#39;, values=&#39;debt&#39;) #df[&#39;income_level&#39;].value_counts() . 19351 . Conclusion . a correlation exists between the amount of children one has and the ability to repay a loan. There also exists a correlation between family status and the ability to repay a loan. . Needs fixing: You should categorize data by income level. The best solution is to create a new column. Improve (review 2): Categorization was done in the right way but it would be better if you&#39;ve created a new column (not replace values in income_level column). Hi reviewer, . Thank you for taking the time out to look at my code. I thought I created a new column. There are two columns. The original &#39;total_income&#39; and the column I created &#39;income_level&#39; based off of that column. . Success (review 3): Sorry, it was my fault. You&#39;re right a new column was created. Step 3. Answer these questions . Needs fixing (review 2): This tep should done in this way: question; calculations using pivot table/groupby. Ratios should ba calculated. This was done correctly: df.pivot_table(index=&#39;have_kids&#39;, values=&#39;debt&#39;) ; some conclusions based on pivot table. Is there a relation between having kids and repaying a loan on time? | . rate = df[&#39;debt&#39;].sum() / df.shape[0] #rate for all loans print(&quot;The rate for all loans is:&quot;, rate,&quot;%&quot;) print(df[&#39;children&#39;].corr(df[&#39;debt&#39;])) #noticed a negative value for children df[&#39;children&#39;] = df[&#39;children&#39;].replace([-1], 0) #replaces -1 w/ 0 df.groupby([&#39;children&#39;])[&#39;debt&#39;].agg([&#39;mean&#39;])[&#39;mean&#39;]*100 # 20 children seems a little outrageous .. could be an error . The rate for all loans is: 0.0811844349129244 % 0.02135295137788271 . children 0 7.472166 1 9.394428 2 9.562399 3 7.482993 4 8.823529 5 0.000000 20 11.940299 Name: mean, dtype: float64 . There does not seem to be a relation between having children and defaulting on loans. There does exist an outlier in the data set. . Improve (review 2): It would be better if conclusion was written in markdown cell, Conclusion . Is there a relation between marital status and repaying a loan on time? | . df.groupby([&#39;family_status&#39;])[&#39;debt&#39;].agg([&#39;mean&#39;])[&#39;mean&#39;]*100 . family_status civil partnership 9.076305 divorced 7.017544 married 7.592210 unmarried 10.059406 widow / widower 6.473988 Name: mean, dtype: float64 . results show that unmarried customers and customers in a civil partnership default more on loans. . Conclusion . Is there a relation between income level and repaying a loan on time? | . print(df[&#39;total_income&#39;].describe()) print(&quot;==============================&quot;) print(df.groupby([&#39;income_level&#39;])[&#39;debt&#39;].agg([&#39;mean&#39;])[&#39;mean&#39;]*100) . count 19351.000000 mean 26787.071262 std 16475.452412 min 3306.000000 25% 16488.000000 50% 23202.000000 75% 32549.500000 max 362496.000000 Name: total_income, dtype: float64 ============================== income_level High Income 5.882353 Highest Tax Bracket 9.090909 Low Income 8.239663 Middle Class 7.111597 Poverty 8.250780 Upper Middle Class 0.000000 Name: mean, dtype: float64 . The high income bracket has defaulted less on loans than the highest income tax bracket. Low Income and Poverty are about the same. Having the highest tax bracket be the highest defaulter of loans seems a bit weird. . Conclusion . How do different loan purposes affect on-time repayment of the loan? | . &quot;If the loan is for school or business, banks might not see a payment on the loan for a while. Versus if the loan is for a house, car, wedding, which are one time things, banks will see a payment after the event has happened&quot; . Conclusion . Needs fixing: These findings should be supported with calculations. For example, in first question you could create column have_kids = (1 if children &gt; 0 else 0). After that compare percentage users repaid the loan on time in 2 groups(have kids/ no kids). You could use &#39;groupby/pivot_table&#39; for it. Step 4. General conclusion . Data categorization is used in data to organize data into categories so it is easy to retrieve/sort data. . Using pivot tables and groupby, I was able to determine that there was no relation between having kids and defaulting on a loan. I was also able to determine that there was an outlier in the data which could have been human error. Using groupby I analyzed the relation between marital status and repaying a loan on time and income level and repaying a loan on time. . Different loan purposes affect on-time repayment because as stated in the conclusion above, one-time events such as weddings or car/house purchases will start to see payment after the event; school/business not so much as the customer might need to take out another loan. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
